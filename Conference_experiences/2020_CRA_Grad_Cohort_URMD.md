Conference Dates and Location: March 5-7, 2020 in Austin, TX
------
The first day was travel stuff and checking in at the hotel. From the airport I used the suggested Shuttle and got to ride with a couple of fellow attendees and tourists. It was quite a seamless process.

It was organized. The recommended app was useful. It had information about the event and about who else was attending.

The first evening had a mixer which was a huge highlight of the Workshop for me. I got to meet a lot of people including my roommate and students from different schools and paths. It was a lot of fun. There were tickets with the badge for free drinks at the mixer including bottled water and OJ. 

The second day was full of sessions organized into three tracks – Early Years, Middle Years, and Later Years. Attendees could attend whatever sessions was presented. There was the common situation in conferences – that is, having to choose between different sessions of interest that are scheduled for the same time at different locations. The locations were very close on the same floor of the hotel and often in adjoining rooms which was great. Sessions included topics like mentoring; Masters vs. Ph.D.; M.S. Career Opportunities and Ph.D. Search; Overcoming Insufficient Academic Preparation, Perceived and Real; Fail Your Way to Success; Finding a Research Topic: Interdisciplinary Research; Building Resiliency and Overcoming Failure; Summer Internships; Industry vs. Academia; Building Your Professional Persona; Ph.D. Academic Career Paths and Job Search; Ph.D. Non-Academic Career Paths and Job Search.

There were also two Poster Sessions and an evening reception.

We had a peer group setting over lunch where each table had a topic of interest and anyone interested in that topic could sit and discuss. My table had a lot of lively discussion with a lot of extremely smart individuals. We exchanged our information at the end. It was so much fun! 

The organizers kept abreast of the unfolding pandemic situation and let us know about refraining from hugging, shaking hands, and other contact, which was quite new at the time, but which would become quite common place shortly. 

The evening reception was at a local restaurant where again there were a lot of interesting discussions. I got to meet a lot of new people and again students from different schools and paths. It was like the wonderful mixer of the evening before but in a different location. I met students who had attended previous URMD Grad Cohorts.  

The third and last day had morning sessions and a Mentoring session and Resume Critique sessions. The setup was interesting. The Mentoring and Resume Critique sessions occurred concurrently but any participant could attend both. For the Mentoring, the mentors each had a table where they sat with a chair across from them at the table. The attendees in line for mentoring specified to a facilitator if they wanted to meet with a specific mentor or the first available. Attendees could also get back in line and see as many mentors as possible or for me for as much time as the upcoming flight home would allow. It was all well-organized. 

If you are a student reading this, and this may not apply to everyone but, I did not have to get any food on my own. There was food at Cohort events and snacks too outside of meals.

I learned a lot from mentors, sessions, peers including practical tips that I could implement right away. Also, I heard from great minds and got to see in person people whose names I had come across before only on paper. 

It was a great workout in professional and personal growth. My confidence grew and although I worked on my research while at the Cohort, I felt energized to tackle it better upon return. 

Overall, Thank You to all who made the opportunity possible to have attended 2020 CRA Grad Cohort for URMD. Likewise, Thank you to the organizers for an enriching, well-organized, and fun Grad Cohort event!

After the conference, I received helpful responses to e-mails. I am privileged to still keep in touch with folks I met there. Consider attending!
