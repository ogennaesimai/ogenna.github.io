# Review of “How to Grow a Robot: Developing Human-Friendly, Social Al; Chapters 11 & 12”
### Problem To Be Solved
These book chapters by author Mark Lee try to solve the problem of what an adequate approach would be in order to build intelligent robots that think and behave like humans. The author notes that “engineering methods do not provide the right approach for building humanlike robots.” Why does he think this way? Although this concept is presented in an earlier part of the book, before these chapters, he is of the opinion that current Al and robotic technology are not as mentally flexible as people and do not think and behave like humans. He adds that there is not much evidence to show that this will change in the future. His solution is to focus on trying to achieve desirable behaviors as opposed to trying to accomplish specific tasks. The author mentions four ways through which humans show intelligence, namely, 1) behavior 2) flexible lines of reasoning 3) adaptive ability to cope with change and new experiences 4) general versatility.

### Good Points
The book chapters have several good points. 

Firstly, they include the history leading up to the current state of the field as at the time of discussion. This history may be useful for such reasons as 1) providing information that may fill in gaps aiding understanding of the approaches presented and 2) providing areas of further research based on the interests of the readers.

Secondly, they each conclude with a section named “Observations” which highlights specific concepts that the author wishes to emphasize. Thus, the author clarifies these concepts to the reader. 

 
### Limitations
Firstly, the book chapters are limited in the regard that while the author decries the use of a task-based approach to achieve Artificial Human Intelligence, the rules provided for the algorithm used in the author’s behavior-based approach look a lot like tasks given to the robot.

Secondly, the algorithm used in the author’s behavior-based approach allows novelty as the only internal value signal for intrinsic motivation. 

### Suggestions For Improvement
Regarding the limitation that the algorithm used in the author’s behavior-based approach allows novelty as the only internal value signal for intrinsic motivation - While this may be a reasonable start for the stage of modeling a baby’s development, in order to model all human intelligence which involves intelligence of adult humans, I would also include additional internal value signals for intrinsic motivation. Examples of such additional internal value signals for intrinsic motivation include duty and responsibility, personal values, and respect for law. These are a few of the motivators that drive human behavior which the author holds is key in human intelligence. As the author states, “The key to human-like robots is growth in behavior, not task expansion.”
