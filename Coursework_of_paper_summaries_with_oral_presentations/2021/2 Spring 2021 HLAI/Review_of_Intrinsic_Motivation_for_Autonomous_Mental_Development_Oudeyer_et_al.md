# Review of “Intrinsic Motivation Systems for Autonomous Mental Development”
### Problem To Be Solved
This paper by authors Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Frédéric Kaplan, and Verena V. Hafner tries to answer the question “Can a machine be endowed with an intrinsic motivation system such as it appears that children have making exploratory activities to be intrinsically rewarding for children and crucial for their cognitive development?”

### Good Points
The paper has several good points. 

Firstly, it successfully presents its own intrinsic motivation system, Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity (IAC), 
“which pushes a robot towards situations in which it maximizes its learning progress.“

Secondly, the paper discusses existing intrinsic motivation systems. This adds breadth and context to the paper’s work.

Thirdly, the paper provides at least a limitation of its own work. This makes the paper more comprehensiveness and robustness.

 
### Limitations
Firstly, as stated in the paper “the sensorimotor apparatus of the robot here is much more limited” referring to the Playground experiment and comparing the robot to the environment in which two- or three-month old children learn their initial sen sorimotor skills. Specifically, the toys in this experiment “can be bitten, bashed, or simply visually detected.” 


### Suggestions For Improvement
Firstly, for improvement of the paper, I would explore extending the the sensorimotor apparatus of the robot in the paper’s Playground experiment. Specifically, I would consider adding to the toys in this experiment, one or more which can be heard.
