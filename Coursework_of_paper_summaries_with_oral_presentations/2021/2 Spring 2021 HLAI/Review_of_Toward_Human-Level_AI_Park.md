# Review of “Toward Human-Level AI”
### Problem To Be Solved
This presentation by Dr. Park, the Course Professor, summarizes the content of the course so far as discussed in the seminars. The focus of the presentation is the trajectory taken in hopes of arriving at human-level AI.

### Good Points
The presentation had several good points, namely it was organized in a clear manner into 3 sections, Theory, Task/Test, and Model. 

Also, it was presented with a variety of formats within the presentation itself, such as videos, diagrams, lists, and other text as well as supplemented outside of the presentation with "chalkboard" writing (due to the virtual format, this was in actuality a virtual writing pad that the students could see as Dr. Park used the writing pad). A variety of formats aids in communicating concepts and in understanding them.

In addition, it was presented clearly. I found it easy to hear and understand the presentation.

Furthermore, the presentation was detailed in both breadth and depth - breadth in that historical features, several references to multiple papers, as well as the work being done by Dr. Park and the students in his lab were covered, and depth in that each topic covered was addressed in enough detail for anyone without an extensive background in the field to be able to follow the talk with a reasonable level of understanding.

Finally, there was opportunity at the end for questions. Several students asked questions which Dr. Park answered.

I learned and found enlightening the step by step process of the rationale leading up to the work being done by Dr. Park and the students in his lab.


### Limitations
The presentation lasted for about an hour and thirty minutes which was a bit at one sitting, although the good thing about having such a presentation is that it can be used as a source to easily create many shorter presentations tailored to different purposes, lengths, and audiences.

### Suggestions For Improvement
None major. On slide 130, at the last line on the slide, is Arbib intended or perhaps, Arviv? To have listened to the presentation was great for me.
