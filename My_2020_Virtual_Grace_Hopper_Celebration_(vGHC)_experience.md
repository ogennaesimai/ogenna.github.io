Introduction, a Background
------
Several individuals, students, and professors alike, had recommended to me that I should attend. As a result, …

… The Scholarship Search
------
First was the scholarship application. Please submit early. My school Wi-Fi which typically works flawlessly had issues on the day of the scholarship deadline. Seriously. Hours to submission deadline, still no internet. I missed the deadline. They were quite strict and were not willing to consider the screenshots of the failure nor a note from the Office of Internet Technology nor an explanation from the Faculty recommender also at my school. So, I did not get it. It was all my fault. Do computer glitches happen exactly hours to the deadline? You know the answer. Would you blame the Scholarship operators who did not wish to consider what happened? Please do not let it happen to you. 

Oh and No, that was not the first time I did not get it. The first time, the application was reviewed but I did not get it.

As a result, you can imagine my excitement when I learned I got it this time! I would finally get to attend this event I had heard so much about, and virtually. Thank you to Microsoft Sponsor for the scholarship! Have you applied and gotten back a response other than Congratulations? Be encouraged. Try again if possible.

The scholarship recipient experience is valuable and worthwhile similar to the Celebration itself. It was enlightening to be part of a social media group to which all GHC scholarship recipients are added, be they students or faculty. There were a lot of interesting and impactful things that had been done, or were being done, or being proposed to be done by scholars. Beware of fear of missing out and feeling that you have to be glued to your screen to catch an opportunity before the event capacity is maxed out. Likewise beware of impostor syndrome. I enjoyed the sessions I got to be a part of. It was perfect for me because I wanted information on so many things and here I was, discovering that many of them were just a virtual session away. Despite the differences in values, backgrounds, personality types, etc. of the individuals, it was generally a community with high levels of passion and motivation.
 
The Agenda
------

Yes. It gets its own section. The Agenda was very interesting, literally, filled with what felt I like hundreds of sessions. The sessions were organized by day and time. Also, you could filter them by track. Being virtual, some were prerecorded while others were live. Sessions fill fast. If you have never attended or gone through an orientation, don’t feel bad if you want to look it up online how it works to save seats at the sessions you want to attend. It is a huge event. It is impressive the numbers of what all needs to be coordinated to produce the final working and flowing system. For a limited time after vGHC, a number of recordings were available which was useful for those two or three want-to-be-there sessions that held at the same or overlapping times during the Celebration or for those you wanted to attend again. 

The Celebration
------
In one word - Memorable. At every session I attended I learned new and helpful things. It is value packed. One of the highlights for me was hearing the remarkable and accomplished Marian Croak share her experiences of challenge and triumph. Another highlight of mine was an enlightening session featuring representatives connected to the USPTO as well as patent holders. Definitely a highlight was the hands-on workshop on GitHub. Unless you are a pro at GitHub be prepared that it may move at a fast pace, as in, at a very fast pace. Remember to complete all the actions recommended to be done before the workshop ahead of time.

Thank you to the organizers for an enriching, well-organized, and fun vGHC event! 

To you reading this, consider attending for the first time or again! Thank you for visiting, and all the best in your endeavors!
