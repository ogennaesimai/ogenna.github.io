# Review of “Deep Neuroethology of A Virtual Rodent”
### Problem(s) To Be Solved
This paper by authors Merel and Aldarondo et al. tries to solve the problem - the knowledge of how neuroscience and deep learning impact the study of motor control lags behind the knowledge of how these fields impact the study of sensory and cognitive systems. Furthermore, it is also a problem that there are no works comprehensively modelling embodied control of an animal including how said animal uses its senses, body, and behaviors to solve tasks in a physical environment.
### What is the Solution to These Problems?
The paper provides a virtual model of a rodent which virtual model lends itself to the study of embodied motor systems. In more detail, the virtual rodent model although being virtual in the sense that it is a computational algorithm is also located in a physical environment where it solves tasks. It gets real, physical sensory inputs - visual and proprioceptive - through a camera mounted on its head. Yes. It has a head, although being virtual, because via software such as MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact) (http://www.mujoco.org/index.html) which the authors use, the virtual rodent has a body.  
### Why is the Virtual Rodent Important?  
It provides an avenue where using deep learning, behaviors (think actions) of a rodent and their underlying motor foundations can be studied to solve the problems in above section “Problem(s) To Be Solved”. 
### Good Points
The paper has several good points. 

Firstly, it lays groundwork for further study of embodied control. 

Secondly, the paper combines several neural network frameworks effectively to achieve the purpose of the desired model. Specifically, these neural network frameworks include recurrent LSTM, residual network, and  multi-layer perceptron.
 
Thirdly, the paper goes beyond the architectures and results of the neural network model to explore the underlying workings of the model such as which features are encoded by which parts of the model. 
 
### Limitations
The paper is limited in that although attempt is made for the study accomplished by the virtual rodent model to be grounded, the physical environment in which the virtual rodent is located is still an artificial one and a limited subset of the real world environment. 
### Suggestions For Improvement
For improvement of the paper, I would broaden the reach of the environment to improve the groundedness of the work done by the paper.

###Review of “Common Sense, The Turing Test, and the Quest for Real AI”
###-Problem To Be Solved:
This book by author Levesque tries to solve the problem of getting a grasp on “Real AI”
###-What is “Real AI?” It is Artificial Intelligence that focuses on common sense as opposed to learning from big data. Levesque describes common sense as being able to achieve predetermined goals in the face of deviations from routines that were used previously to achieve the same goals. This kind of AI was practiced by certain AI researchers that he lists, and they did so in the 1950’s. He also equates Real AI with the term Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI).
###-Why is This Book Important? It provides a personal view which makes for increased knowledge and understanding. Specifically, the author’s view emphasizes practical usefulness as an important aspect of “Real AI.” The book also discusses The Turing Test which we have discussed in this class.

###-Good Points:
The book has several good points. 

Firstly, it clearly states the author’s opinion. There is not much ambiguity as to where he stands on the issues at hand. 

Secondly, the author uses plenty of anecdotes that are effective in helping the reader understand more quickly the ideas the author conveys.

###-Limitations:
The paper is limited in the regard that as a test of intelligence, the WSC is not universal or general in the scope of the intelligence. Rather, it is primarily a test tied closely to linguistic and related intelligence. 

###-Suggestions For Improvement:
For improvement of the book, I would explore the reasons behind opposing views. This might serve to strengthen the author’s argument.
