# Review of “Grounded Language Learning in a Simulated 3D World”
### Problem(s) To Be Solved
This paper by authors by Karl Moritz Hermann & Felix Hill et al. tries to solve the problem of an agent being able to communicate with agents using human language in a way that is grounded and scalable.

### Good Points
The paper has several good points. 

Firstly, it successfully creates an agent that is able to understand human language, specifically, words written in English and carry out tasks based on understanding the written instructions. 

Secondly, the paper contributes experimental validation to several concepts regarding learning. For example, the speed of learning increases as extent of prior vocabulary increases.

Thirdly, the paper shows that unsupervised learning or bootstrap learning plays a major role in human language acquisition/learning of an agent compared to reinforcement learning.

Fourthly, the paper shows that an agent can be subjected to a curriculum and increase its learning as a result. This finding may have practical implications in the teaching of students/ the domain of education and learning in humans.
 
 
### Limitations
Firstly, the paper is limited in the regard that its environment used for groundedness is a simulated 3D environment. That is, the work done in the paper is grounded but with respect to a simulated 3D environment as opposed to with respect to a real-world physical environment.

Secondly, in human-agent communication, it focuses on the use of human language as the means of communication.

Thirdly, in using human language for communicating between humans and agents, the paper uses written instructions.
 
### Suggestions For Improvement
Firstly, for improvement of the paper, I would explore having the agent perform in a real-world physical environment no matter how restricted. 

Secondly, in human-agent communication, other avenues of communication besides human language may be considered. Such avenues include images.

Thirdly, in the scope of using human language for communicating between humans and agents, because human communication involves meaning that is contributed by differences in pronunciation of the same word, for example, the written instructions may be supplemented by sound to increase the ability convey meaning to a greater degree.
