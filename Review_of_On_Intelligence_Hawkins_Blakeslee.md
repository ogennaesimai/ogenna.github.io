# Review of “On Intelligence Chapters 3 - 6”
### Problem To Be Solved
This book by authors Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee tries to solve the problem of providing a comprehensive theory of how the brain works. It also notes that a lack had existed of putting what is known about how the brain works into a coherent, theoretical framework. It set out to fill in this void.


### Good Points (Plus which Chapters were Tagged Essential)
The book chapters have several good points. 

Firstly, its language style is simple making it easier to follow than if the language was more complicated. 

Secondly, it mentions other view points different from those of the authors. This adds balance to the work. For example, the book mentions that others may find different parts of the brain important with regards to intelligence other than the neocortex, which is the part of the brain that this book focuses on in its argument. Also, it notes that Turing was wrong in believing that behavior determines intelligence.
