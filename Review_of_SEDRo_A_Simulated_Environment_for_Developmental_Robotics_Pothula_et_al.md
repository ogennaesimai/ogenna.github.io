# Review of “SEDRo: A Simulated Environment for Developmental Robotics”
### Problem To Be Solved
This paper by authors Aishwarya Pothula et al. tries to solve the problem of how to produce an algorithm/a program (the paper calls this “a model”) that is capable of human-like learning and capable of performing multiple tasks. The paper identifies the root of the problem to be lack of ability to implement such an algorithm. Furthermore, the paper cites a major contributing factor to this inability to implement to be a lack of diverse human experiences that are required for human-like learning or learning in a human-like way.

### Good Points
The paper has several good points. 

Firstly, it successfully provides a solution to address the lack of diverse human experiences that are required for human-like learning as described above by providing such experiences in the simulated environment for developmental robotics (SEDRo). 

Secondly, the paper addresses several limitations of its own work.

Thirdly, following closely on the immediately preceding point, the paper provides suggestions on how these limitations might be overcome.

Fourthly, the paper also provides a review of the literature especially as it relates to the current gaps in the field that the paper is trying to fill.
 

 
### Limitations
Firstly, the paper is limited in the regard that its human experiences are restricted to the fetal to infant stages of life whereas childhood extends farther.

Secondly, in human-agent communication, here caregiver-agent communication, it focuses on a manual generation of scenarios.

Thirdly, for Fig. 4, due to the use of red and green colors side by side, this figure would be difficult to be seen and understood by individuals who have red-green color blindness.

Fourthly, sensory input for SEDRo is comprised of touch, vision, acceleration,
gravity, and proprioceptors. Nevertheless, there is evidence that suggests that unborn babies may be able to hear. Therefore, omitting sound in sensory input may omit a potentially important part of learning that occurs in the human fetus thereby limiting the learning of the SEDRo model.

### Suggestions For Improvement
Firstly, for improvement of the paper, I would explore extending the age of the agent beyond 12 months. 

Secondly, in caregiver-agent communication, I would explore an automated method of generating scenarios. This would have the advantage of being less time and effort intensive and provide a lot of data in a shorter amount of time. The current method is using principles of developmental psychology. Therefore, to maintain quality of the automated-generated scenarios, the automated method would still need to be set up in such a way that it follows the same principles of developmental psychology, also to be valid and meet the criteria used for the original scenarios.

Thirdly, for Fig. 4, in order to improve the ease of seeing and understanding this figure by individuals who have red-green color blindness, I would use a different color scheme that does not involve using red and green colors side by side. For example, I might use red with a non-green color or use green with a non-red color or use an entirely different set of colors other than red and other than green.

Fourthly, for sensory input for SEDRo I would also use sound. This would help the model be more like human babies and better model the learning that human babies undergo.
