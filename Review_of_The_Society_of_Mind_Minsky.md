# Review of “The Society of Mind (both as above)”
### Problem To Be Solved
The book attempts to explain how minds work. As the first sentence of the first paragraph (to distinguish this sentence from the preceding quote) states “This book tries to explain how minds work.”

The paper by the same author provides more on the opinions of the author and also serving as an autobiographical context for the book.

### Good Points (Plus which Chapters were Tagged Essential and Notes on Each)<sup>1</sup> 
The book and paper have several good points. 

Firstly, their language is simple making it easier to follow than if the language was more complicated. 

Secondly, the tone is almost conversational again aiding understanding of the author's points.

... **Essential Chapters in the Book** ...

1.3 The society of mind - In science, one can learn the most by studying what seems the least.

1.4 The world of blocks - Amnesia of infancy. Forgetting we ever learned skills that are now second nature that they are considered common sense.

1.5 Common Sense - Common sense is not a simple thing. Instead, it is an immense society of hard-earned practical ideas.

1.6 Agents and Agencies – Describe components required in process in a human’s mind in order to carry out a task. Each component is both an agent and an agency. Agent only activates or inactivates other agents. Agency accomplishes all what its subagents accomplish.

2.1 Components and Connections – Highlights that one cannot understand how a process component works just from knowing its subagents. One needs to  understand 1) how each subagent 
works, 2) the interactions between the subagent and other subagents to which it is connected, and 3) how these interactions combine to accomplish the task that the entire system accomplishes.

2.5 Easy things are hard – It was very complicated to build a robot that was a working Builder agency that could build with children’s blocks. “In general, we’re least aware of what our minds do best.”

3.1 Conflict – Is possible within a system when competing subagents disagree. This tends to weaken their mutual superior which may allow hitherto dormant colleagues of the superior with conflicting subagents to take control and become active.

3.2 Noncompromise – Rephrases the effect of conflict. page 33.

3.3 Hierarchies – Agents and subagents are organized in ~ where an agent administratively controls subagents.

3.4 Heterarchies – Provide a solution of progress when a hierarchy stalls because 2 colleague or hierarchy agents at the same level  need each other to get a current task done.

3.5 Destructiveness – Can serve any of several purposes of what destructive acts accomplish for the child.

4.2 One self or many? – Musings about a human being conscious of himself being a unified self or being torn between different paths of action which the writer describes this latter state as having multiple selves.

6.4 B-Brains – Having an entity not connected to the world like the regular (A-) brain is but this entity is only connected to the A-brain and having this entity do the work of self-evaluation, self-talk, and self-monitoring that humans are wont to do from time to time. Minsky names this entity a B-brain.

 
### Limitations
Firstly, they are limited to largely opinions of the author.


### Suggestions For Improvement
Firstly, for improvement of both works, I would explore adding other viewpoints on the same matters for a more balanced presentation.

<sup>1</sup>On second thought, no pun intended, I thought it might be useful to specify which the essential chapters were and my notes on each while reading.
