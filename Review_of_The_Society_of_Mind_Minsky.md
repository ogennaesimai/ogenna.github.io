# Review of “The Society of Mind (both as above)”
### Problem To Be Solved
The book attempts to explain how minds work. As the first sentence of the first paragraph (to distinguish this sentence from the preceding quote) states “This book tries to explain how minds work.”

The paper by the same author provides more on the opinions of the author and also serving as an autobiographical context for the book.

### Good Points
The book and paper hav several good points. 

Firstly, their language is simple making it easier to follow than if the language was more complicated. 

Secondly, the tone is almost conversational again aiding understanding of the author's points.

 
### Limitations
Firstly, they are limited to largely opinions of the author.


### Suggestions For Improvement
Firstly, for improvement of both works, I would explore adding other viewpoints on the same matters for a more balanced presentation.
