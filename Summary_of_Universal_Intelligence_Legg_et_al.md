# Review of “Universal Intelligence”
### Problem To Be Solved
This paper by authors Legg and Hutter tries to solve the problem that a formal, mathematical definition of intelligence is not available. The authors achieve this by collecting various definitions of human intelligence and extracting from them three common features and then formalizing the common features into a mathematical formula which is their definition of an agent’s universal intelligence or alternatively, which is their definition of an agent’s expected performance with respect to the universal distribution over the space of all environments. These common features are that intelligence 1) is a property of an individual who is interacting with an external environment, problem, situation, 2) is related to ability to succeed or ‘‘profit,’’ thereby introducing the concept of a goal or objective to be achieved, and 3) involves the ability to deal with a range of possibilities including unanticipated, thereby introducing the concepts of quick learning and adaptation.
### Good Points
The paper has several good points, namely in addition to providing a formal, mathematical definition of intelligence, it relates the definition to an earlier work by the last author of this paper, Hutter. In other words, it successfully extends a prior work, an ‘‘intelligence order relation’’ that was used to describe equations that capture a perfect theoretical agent, AIXI. Furthermore, in addition to the collection of various definitions of human intelligence that it includes, it also provides a survey and a comparison of tests/definitions of machine intelligence. It is an advantage to have many  tests/definitions collated in one source. Finally, it is also a good point that the paper addresses several criticisms of the paper’s formal definition of intelligence. I learned and found enlightening the step by step process that the paper goes through to consolidate and formalize features into a valid definition measuring an entity, intelligence in this case, as desired. 
### Limitations
The paper is limited in the regard that its definition is an approximation. As a result, any results potentially obtained from it would also be approximations as opposed to actual measurements of machine intelligence. The paper is also limited in the regard that its definition is not readily transferrable to measure practically the intelligence of machines. It is largely theoretical with regards to the fact that no tests exist yet that use it to measure machine intelligence.
### Suggestions For Improvement
For improvement of the paper, firstly, because it has been almost fifteen years since the paper was written, I would start by reviewing the field of definitions of machine intelligence to take into account any advances, if any. Secondly, I would formulate a definition without approximation or with less approximation. Thirdly, I would also use the definition to formulate a test with which to assess a machine’s intelligence.
